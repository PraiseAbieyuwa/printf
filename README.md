This directory is a team project of two members working on the printf function
A typical printf takes a format string as its first argument, followed by zero or more additional arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string. The format string contains placeholders that specify the desired format and location of the additional arguments in the output.
The printf function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte at the end) or a negative value if an error occurs
some common format specifiers used with printf include:
%d or %i: for printing integers.
%f: for printing floating-point numbers.
%c: for printing a single character.
%s: for printing a string.
%%: for printing a literal percent sign
In addition, the printf function has many more features and options, including formatting width, precision, alignment, and more.
